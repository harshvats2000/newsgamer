<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Me and my brother used to play a game in newspapers. Every morning, we pickup pen and a paper and then started to find words starting with letter <strong>"A"</strong>. The one who underlines 10 words first, will be the winner. We play 10-12 games and then there was no word starting with "A" left which was not underlined, then we start the game with letter "B" and so on. Then he got busy in his life and me in mine.

I got admitted in IIT(ISM) Dhanbad for mining engineering but got some interest in computer programming. I was never the guy who wanted to do competitive programming for getting placed. I tried that but eventually got back to what i love the most, building real products. I was sick of just solving algorithmic problems and wanted to build some products. I build some really cool products but this one is my favorite.

I built newsgamer for a few reasons.

- This game can allow me and my brother to play this game even if we are anywhere around the globe.
- We just need a mobile phone or laptop to play this.
- We can search words in the same paragraph unlike newspaper in which we used to search words in different paper so difficulty levels were different.
- Will be a good learning for me to build real world project which anyone can play.
