  "Recently I was thinking about how much I used to use CSS and nowadays I don't. Don't get me wrong, CSS is still running under the hood and empowering the web pages and sometimes other applications' layouts as well. But how much are we involved in CSS actually these days and how much do we get our hands dirty working with it? Since there are awesome frameworks like Zurb Foundation, Bootstrap, Vuetify, Semantic UI, and many more I think the importance of understanding CSS for new developers getting into web development is slightly losing its value. And recently Tailwind is taking over the development world with its utility first approach. So I decided to write this article explaining my experience with CSS since pure vanilla CSS till advanced frameworks like Vuetify. In case you are a newcomer to the web development world you might get confused with all these tools out there named SASS/SCSS, LESS Stylus, and so many more. CSS (stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is a language (not a programming language) used for describing the presentation of a web page. In a simpler way, CSS is used for giving your web page beauty. CSS features a concept of selectors and attributes. It is pretty simple, a selector selects an element or multiple elements and applies some styles to them. There are two imaginations of how CSS works, many people think CSS selectors apply the styles to the elements and some people think it is the element that selects to use the styles of a CSS definition. But it is good to know that it is CSS that selects your elements. Preprocessors were the first step to kill vanilla CSS. You can barely see someone writing vanilla CSS in an enterprise project. The only people who are using vanilla CSS might be the students who are learning web development in the early stages. A framework might seem scary when calling it a FRAMEWORK but it is literally a pre-written CSS file that helps you move forward without writing lots of CSS codes yourself. For instance, a button might look ugly on a webpage without proper CSS customization. A framework gives you a simple way to apply a default style to your button. So this is another step that strays us further from CSS and understanding it. Using a framework might get really in the way of understanding some advanced concepts of CSS like grids or positioning and it isn't a good thing in my opinion. If you are working with new tools of web development like Vue or React you are highly likely using a component library to render your UI. I'm using Vuetify as my primary UI framework. When using these frameworks you might not even need to work with classes and most components already have a default look. See this simple box with shadows and borders built using Vuetify. In most projects, you won't even need to write a single line of CSS when using frameworks. This is an absolutely personal opinion. I think CSS is going to be something like Assembly language. Eventually, no one is going to use it directly but it is going to empower other tools, only some people with high knowledge of CSS will be on the side of making and developing higher-level tools.",
  "Over the last few days, since it became clear that Trump had Covid, pundit after pundit has, weepily, asked you and I to do something remarkable: to have empathy for a figure like Donald Trump. But should we? Has anyone really thought this through? Would it in fact be corrosive to have empathy for someone responsible for so much misery, suffering, and heartache? Or not? It’s often said that Donald Trump has no empathy, but the truth is darker still. Like narcissists of a certain kind, he has the opposite of empathy, not just its absence: malice. He perpetually bears a grudge. A brief list of people he’s dehumanized, vilified, and scapegoated includes the disabled, the sick, minorities, gay people, women, the press, “liberals,” opponents — it goes on and on. Donald Trump wishes the world the worst if it’s not subservient to his desires, which is the emotion behind his many tantrums and outbursts. If you don’t submit to him, you become an “enemy,” a “traitor,” someone who deserve only the worst. That is malice. It is the primary attitude and emotion of a malignant narcissist, and it is what defines Donald Trump’s personality type, like so many other authoritarians. If the world doesn’t revolve around them — they are very happy to see it crash and burn. Or, in Trump’s case, for a nation to fall ill with Covid, and end up with more than 200,000 dead. What should be immediately apparent, then, is that asking us to have empathy for a figure like Donald Trump immediately gives rise to a double standard. We are to feel something for a man who feels nothing for us, except to see the rest of us hateful, weak, and contemptible. But the question of empathy for the malicious goes much deeper than that. When pundits say “empathy,” they don’t really examine what they mean. They mean something like sympathy, perhaps, or casual well-wishes. To have empathy, though, is to step inside someone’s emotional center, their psyche, their soul, their mind. And that is where having empathy for a figure like Donald Trump begins to get genuinely troubling. To empathise with Donald Trump means to feel his emotions, and to sympathise with the moral logic that produces them. It means to feel all the terrible things he has said, and mean them, to an extent: that immigrants are vermin, that refugees and minorities are animals, that women are objects to be exploited, that power is a thing to be abused. It is to say that there is some kind of tolerable logic behind putting children in concentration camps, and cutting women open in them. When we “empathise” with such abuses of power, then we are also normalising and legitimating them. Or at least we run the grave risk of doing so. We are being asked to say, “hey, I understand! I get why you would feel that way!” But is it remotely normal to pretend that one “gets” why a figure like Trump would want to treat mass death with indifference or order his shock troops to beat and abduct people in the streets?",
